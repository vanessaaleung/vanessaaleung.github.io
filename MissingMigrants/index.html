	   <p class="article-text">Missing Migrants Project tracks deaths of migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, who have gone missing along mixed migration routes worldwide. The research behind this project began with the October 2013 tragedies, when at least 368 individuals died in two shipwrecks near the Italian island of Lampedusa. Since then, Missing Migrants Project has developed into an important hub and advocacy source of information that media, researchers, and the general public access for the latest information.</p>
	   <p class="article-text"> From the map we can see that most of the incidents took place on the Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America continents.</p>
	   <p class="article-text">The top five regions of incidents are Mediterranean, North Africa, Southeast Asia, US-Mexico Border and Sbu-saharan Afraica. The incidents in Mediterranean increased dramatically in 2016. But we can see that figures in all the regions show an upward trend.</p>
	   <p class="article-text"> The number of dead and missing rose sharply from 2014 to 2015, and experienced an significant increase in 2017. When breaking down the number to gender, the number of males victims was almost three times higher than the one of females.</p>
	   <p class="article-text">As for the main causes of the tragics, drowning appears on the top of the list, followed by sickness, vehicle accident, and the mix of them.</p>
